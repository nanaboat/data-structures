Hi Salma,   
I hope all is well, I stumbled across your profile and 
I'm very interested in learning more about your personal experiences and 
the engineering culture at Adobe!   
A little about me, I've had the opportunity to work professionally @ 
Intel for 2.5 years in a Software Engineer role. 
Which has allowed me to work with cutting edge technology, 
contribute to open source and build applications that require Cloud, 
Full Stack, and Mobile development knowledge.   
I'm most excited when solving 




 I hope all is well, I will love to connect with you on LinkedIn. I realize you are hiring for Apple and I'm currently actively looking for opportunities. I look forward to connecting with you so I can share my professional experiences.
Thanks,
Prince.
