542. 01 Matrix
Medium

Given a matrix consists of 0 and 1, find the distance of the nearest 0 for each cell.

The distance between two adjacent cells is 1.

 

Example 1:

Input:
[[0,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [0,0,0]]

Output:
[[0,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [0,0,0]]

Example 2:

Input:
[[0,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [1,1,1]]

Output:
[[0,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [1,2,1]]

 

Note:

    The number of elements of the given matrix will not exceed 10,000.
    There are at least one 0 in the given matrix.
    The cells are adjacent in only four directions: up, down, left and right.

Concluding thoughts on BFS :
    - Problems in which you have to find shortest path are most likely calling for a
      BFS.
    - For graphs having unit edge distances, shortest paths from any point is just a
      BFS starting at that point, no need for Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.
    - Maze solving problems are mostly shortest path problems and every maze is just
      a fancy graph so you get the flow.
